# url-shortener-using-flask

Flask is a Python framework for building lightweight and dynamic web applications. It helps speed up tedious behind-the-scenes development work, such as URL mapping, and offers more control than its closest competitor, Django.

With this project you can shorten any url and files in your local machine. That is you can set up a shortcut to access a particular site or file in your system. You can also see the list of shortcuts you created in the home page.

Here's how you can run this in your system:
1. Clone this git and go to the cloned directory
2. Open a terminal window there
3. Run the following commands:
  i. 'pip install pipenv'
  ii. 'pipenv install'
  iii. 'pipenv shell'
  iv. 'export FLASK_APP=urlshort'
  v. 'flask run'
  
  Flask app "urlshort" should now run in your system which you can access by going to '127.0.0.1:5000' in your browser.
  
  Note: In case you want to develop it further run the command 'export FLASK_ENV=development' just before 'flask run'.
